Social Media Dashboard Frontend Mentor project using Sass

## Background
I completed my **Social Media Dashboard** project using CSS Grid and Flexbox. I wanted to challenge myself during this project, so I decided to use **Sass**. 

When I started this project I thought initially the only code I needed were the **CSS Variables**. I learned quickly that Sass was an extension for CSS and more than just the variables. I like that when I use Sass that I'm practicing my skills with node_modules. Speaking of **modules**, I was pleasantly surprised that Sass uses [modules](https://sass-lang.com/guide) so that you can write your styles in multiple files. Depending on the version you are using, you would use @import or @use to load the Sass files as modules into the main SCSS sheet. 

The toughest part of the project was the JavaScript for the **theme toggle**. After researching, I realized there were many ways to code color theme switch for webpages. I think I have found one of the most direct ways to code the toggle-switch in for my webpage. I used a **data-theme** element to represent my "Dark Theme". The "Light Theme" was my default color scheme.
