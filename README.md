# Social-Media-Dashboard-with-Sass-TLP
Social Media Dashboard Frontend Mentor project using Sass

![Design Preview for Social Media Dashboard Challenge from Frontend Mentor](./design/desktop-preview.jpg) 

## Background
I completed the Manage Landing Page using Bootstrap, CSS Grid, and Flexbox. It's a mobile-first design starting with screen-size 375px. I used BEM Guidelines for naming my CSS classes. 

I have added media queries for the following minimum screen width of 768px. 

The page design uses background images on different sections including the section above the footer.
