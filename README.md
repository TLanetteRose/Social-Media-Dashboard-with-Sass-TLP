# Social-Media-Dashboard-with-Sass-TLP
Social Media Dashboard Frontend Mentor project using Sass

![Design Preview for Social Media Dashboard Challenge from Frontend Mentor](./design/desktop-preview.jpg) 

## Background
I completed my Social Media Dashboard project using CSS Grid and Flexbox. I wanted to challenge myself during this project, so I decided to use Sass. 

When I started this project I thought initially the only code I needed were the CSS Variables. I learned quickly that Sass was an extension for CSS and more than just the variables.
